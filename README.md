Cars have few options when it comes to expressing themselves on the road. Blinkers for left and right, hazards to park wherever they please, high beams to say cops ahead, and of course, the horn. This lacks emotion. There has to be another way for vehicles to show how they really feel. Maybe someone let you in to merge when nobody else would. In my opinion, they deserve a little more love than a wave.
